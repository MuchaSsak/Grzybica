Since he was <span class="text-primaryCyan500">the only one that actually knew how to do it</span> at first, giving out help has became a regular thing. Because the concept was so simple, it <span class="text-primaryCyan500">wasn't very obvious that it can be so powerful</span>, but people finally began to understand how big of a chaos it can make.<br><br><span class="mx-[1rem] text-primaryCyan500">•</span>With <span class="text-primaryCyan500">many people knowing</span> that an outstanding infection of <span class="font-bold">Grzybica</span> is <span class="text-primaryCyan500">all around the class</span> and <span class="font-bold">The Creator</span> can cause so <span class="text-primaryCyan500">much damage to anyone</span> in a matter of seconds, the <span class="text-primaryCyan500">enormous fear</span> has risen. So much in fact, that <span class="text-primaryCyan500">trust issues</span> were absolutely normal and <span class="text-primaryCyan500">security measures</span> had to be strictly watched out for or else who knows when it can happen...<br><br><span class="mx-[1rem] text-primaryCyan500">•</span>One day, <span class="font-bold">The Creator</span> saw a huge <span class="text-primaryCyan500">opportunity to improve the design of</span> the script. By being inspired by a <span class="text-primaryCyan500">very simple way</span> of <span class="font-italic">grzybing</span> the computer, he began working. It was <span class="text-primaryCyan500">genius</span>. It was just like the original concept, but different enough to flood Mucha with different yet <span class="text-primaryCyan500">similar ideas</span>. All combined, a <span class="font-bold">Grzybica 2.0</span> formed. That happened in <span class="text-primaryCyan500">12/21/2022</span> and it's a very important date for the <span class="font-bold">Grzybsters Community</span>.<br><br><span class="mx-[1rem] text-primaryCyan500">•</span><span class="text-primaryCyan500">Excitement</span> among <span class="font-bold">The Creator</span> and his teammates in-action rose.
